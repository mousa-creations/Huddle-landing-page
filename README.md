## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-end open source toolkit

### Continued development

I developed this landing page using HTML, CSS, and the awesome toolkit framework Bootstrap. I'm proud that is my first project using updated Bootstrap 5.1. It took more time to learn Bootstrap, and I hope it will be a great launch for bigger projects soon.
